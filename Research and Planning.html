    <b>Floor plan:</b>
        The floor plan consists of two classrooms, A and B, a kitchen, office, administrative office, bathroom, science lab, corridor, and computer room.
        The network model in Cisco Packet Tracer shows Classroom A and the Admin Office. I followed the plan when creating the network, but in the process I decided to change some aspects, which I explain in the video, along with the context of these two rooms in the floor plan.
        Key components include physical aspects of the room such as windows and doors, IoTs such as fans, and end devices such as PCs.
        A fire safety system was also implemented to ensure a safe school environment.
        End devices and IoTs are connected wirelessly to each room’s router, which is in turn connected to a central school router that links the network to the internet.

                routers; 192.168.0.1 (subnet mask 255.255.0.0); CLAwr.0.1 = 192.168.1.1; ADMwr.0.1 = 192.168.2.1
                DHCP for IoT connected to routers; CLAwr.0.1 = 192.168.1.100 (subnet mask 255.255.255.0); ADMwr.0.1 = 192.168.2.100 (subnet mask 255.255.255.0)
                Masking
                DHCP; enable on routers, automatically allocates/assigns device-specific IP addresses to each device on router's network, ensures no two devices share an IP address and thus encounter connection error
            Naming and updating devices
                Orderly classification e.g. LABpc.0.1 for the lab PCs, CLAlig.0.1 for a classroom A light, CLBfan.0.1 for a classroom B fan
                Always ensure that all devices’ firmware is up to date
            Cybersecurity procedures
                Make sure all systems are up to date
                Follow strict security protocols
                Discuss the pros and cons of hardwired fire alarms (reliable, not easily influenced)
                Firewalls (explain how most routers have built in firewalls, or explain how to enable it in the router settings)
            Configuring security protocols
                Assign different users to different/relevant user groups and give each group different access privileges
                Ports, IP addresses, MAC addresses
                Blocking applications, firewalls
            Wire and wireless connections
            Simulate traffic
                Show how network you designed handles traffic, show how it is secure, highlight how it can generate a lot of traffic and send it from point A to point B quickly
                e.g. PC pings (ICMP traffic), send files (TFTP server), web traffic (HTTP traffic), email traffic (SMTP and POP3 traffic), streaming traffic (video/audio streaming)
