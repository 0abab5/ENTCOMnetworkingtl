  <b>Task Weighting</b>
      This task will be worth 35% of your final mark for this year.
  
  <b>Description</b>
      Students are to design and build a virtual data network for an organisation. The design and documentation of the network is to be presented in a website format. There should be a video presentation of the network along with static information on the pages about IP addressing and other features including relevant graphics and diagrams.
      The video should be no more than 7 minutes in length and feature a voice over and use screen recording technology. Students should prepare for their video by creating a storyboard and script.
      Students explore configuring a device and show in the video how to name the device, update the device, configure security protocols, connect to the internet, implement procedures and security protocols considering cybersecurity. Students explore opportunities for optimising network performance, including improving bandwidth and updating drivers and firmware.
      Projects should evaluate the role of hardware and software related to the transmission of data including unsecured data, encrypted data and infrastructure.
