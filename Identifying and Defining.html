    <b>Location:</b>
        This network model was designed for a school. 

    <b>Purpose and components of the network:</b>
        A school network provides reliable and secure connectivity for students, teachers, and administrative staff. It typically includes a combination of wired and wireless connections to ensure comprehensive coverage across different areas. The network infrastructure consists of routers and firewalls to manage traffic and ensure security. High-speed internet access is provided to support online learning and research. Cybersecurity measures including firewalls, antivirus software, different access privileges and regular updates are implemented to protect against threats and maintain a safe digital environment for all users.
     
    <b>IoTs in the network model:</b>
        Student laptops, mobile phones, school PCs
        Air conditioners, fans, lights
        Smoke detectors, sirens, fire sprinklers
    
    <b>Additional IoTs in the network floor plan for a school:</b>
        Smart boards, printers, id scanners, telephones
        Stage lights, microphones
        Stoves, ovens, microwaves, fridges, dishwashers, coffee machines
        Gas taps</pre>
